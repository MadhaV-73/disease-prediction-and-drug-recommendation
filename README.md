Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation


This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning-based system to predict diseases and recommend appropriate drugs. 
The project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques to provide reliable disease diagnosis and drug recommendations.

Features
Disease Prediction: Predicts diseases based on patient symptoms or test results using trained machine learning models.

Drug Recommendation: Suggests relevant drugs for the predicted disease, ensuring effective treatment options.

Interactive Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed, step-by-step implementations of the pipeline.

Scalable Codebase: Modular structure for easy customization and extension.
